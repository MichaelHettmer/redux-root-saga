## Code and style guidelines

The repository contains configuration files for eslint and prettier alongside strict typescript settings. Just use them and you're good to go. Below is a list of the most important points.

- Intendation of 4 spaces except for 2 spaces in JSON/YAML files
- Semicolon at the end of every statement
- Single quotes except JSX/TSX properties with double quotes
- Always insert a trailing comma if possible
- JSX/TSX brackets should be in the same line
- Maximum 120 characters per line
- Typescript with strict mode enabled
- Detailed comments for every class / function / property / parameter using TSDoc notation
